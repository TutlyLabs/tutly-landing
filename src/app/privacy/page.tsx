                details such as their full name, email address, institutional

                assignments, grades, attendance records, and interactions with
                course materials. Additionally, when users communicate with us

            2. How We Use Your Data
          </h1>
          <p>
            The primary reason for collecting user data is to ensure the smooth
            operation of Tutly and provide a personalized learning experience.
            We use the information to create instructor accounts, enroll
            students, process assignments, and generate course-related
            statistics. Instructors are provided with student progress reports,
            submission details, and performance analytics to manage their
            courses effectively. <br />
            Beyond operational purposes, we utilize collected data to improve
            platform functionality, enhance user experience, and fix technical
            issues. By analyzing user behavior, we can optimize course
            recommendations and learning paths. We also use the information to
            detect unauthorized access attempts, prevent fraud, and comply with
            legal obligations. Additionally, we may send platform-related
            announcements, service updates, or promotional content, though users
            have the option to unsubscribe from non-essential communications at
            any time.

            3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
          </h1>
          <p>
            Tutly does not sell or rent user data to third parties. However, we
            may share specific data in cases where it is necessary for platform
            functionality or legal compliance. Instructors have access to
            relevant student data, such as course progress, assignment
            submissions, and attendance records, to evaluate and assist their
            students. <br /> In some cases, we may need to disclose user data to
            legal authorities if required by law, such as in response to court
            orders or government requests. Additionally, we work with
            third-party service providers for payment processing, analytics, and
            security enhancements. These entities are contractually bound to
            maintain the confidentiality of user information and use it solely
            for the intended purposes.

          </h1>
          <p>
            We take data security seriously and implement advanced security
            measures to safeguard user information. All data transmissions on
            Tutly are encrypted using SSL/TLS encryption to prevent unauthorized
            access. We enforce strict access controls, ensuring that only
            authorized personnel can access sensitive data. Our platform is
            protected by firewalls and intrusion detection systems that
            continuously monitor for potential threats. <br /> Additionally, we
            conduct regular data backups to prevent data loss in case of system
            failures. While we strive to maintain the highest level of security,
            it is important to note that no online system can guarantee absolute
            protection. Users are encouraged to use strong passwords, enable
            two-factor authentication where possible, and report any suspicious
            activities related to their accounts.
